# Device-Framed HTML Mockup

## Structure
- Outer frame `<div>` sized to the point canvas recorded per `viewports.md` (Xcode Device
  Hub size, source stated in the spec; 1pt = 1px in the mockup, no arbitrary scaling).
- `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, viewport-fit=cover">` to allow
  safe-area simulation.
- Safe areas via `env(safe-area-inset-top)`, `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`,
  `env(safe-area-inset-left)`, `env(safe-area-inset-right)` — pad content so nothing sits
  under the Dynamic Island/notch or home indicator.

## Rule
The mockup is a visual reference for the handoff spec, not a functional prototype — no
gesture/scroll simulation is required, but the static frame must be pixel-accurate to the
device viewport so a developer can trust the proportions.
