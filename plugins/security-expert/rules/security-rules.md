# Security Rules

Single source for the severity scale, the noise policy and the report format of the security-expert agent and `/scan`.

## Standards (current editions)

Every full repository audit (not a partial `--deps-only` / `--headers` / `--auth` run) checks all ten OWASP Top 10:2025 categories (https://owasp.org/projects/top-ten — https://top10.owasp.org/2025):
- **A01** Broken Access Control (includes SSRF, CSRF)
- **A02** Security Misconfiguration
- **A03** Software Supply Chain Failures
- **A04** Cryptographic Failures
- **A05** Injection (SQLi, XSS, CMDi)
- **A06** Insecure Design
- **A07** Authentication Failures
- **A08** Software or Data Integrity Failures
- **A09** Security Logging and Alerting Failures
- **A10** Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions

Each finding cites a CWE id plus the applicable standard entry; a CVE id only for a known vulnerability in a dependency.

## Severity (single definition)

| Severity | Definition | Examples |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **CRITICAL** | Directly exploitable, no or low privilege, leads to remote code execution, full data compromise or credential exposure | Hardcoded live secret, SQL/command injection, `eval`/`exec` on user input |
| **HIGH** | Exploitable with a realistic precondition; leads to account takeover, unauthorized data access or privilege escalation | Broken access control on an object, stored XSS, unvalidated redirect used in an auth flow |
| **MEDIUM** | Exploitable only under specific, concrete conditions, or limited impact | Reflected XSS behind an unusual precondition, weak crypto protecting non-critical data |
| **LOW** | Real weakness with a shown attack path but minor impact | Information disclosure of non-sensitive internals |

This scale is the only one for reported findings. A CVSS score or a skill's baseline (e.g. a header's default level) is an input to this scale, never a substitute: the final severity is set by the definitions above.

CRITICAL and HIGH findings are flagged in the handoff as blocking for the caller; remediation is the caller's decision and dispatch.

## Verification and Confidence

- Every candidate goes through a second, read-only pass that tries to refute it: data flow traced to the sink, framework protections checked, reachability checked.
- Confidence 1-10. **≥ 8 → reported finding**; < 8 → "Needs manual review" list with the reason.
- Every reported finding has a concrete exploit scenario.
- Basis: Anthropic's security-review command (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthropics/claude-code-security-review/main/.claude/commands/security-review.md) — one finding pass, one false-positive filter per finding, findings under confidence 8 dropped — and Claude Code Security, where "Claude re-examines each result, attempting to prove or disprove its own findings" (https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-code-security).

## Not Reported (noise policy)

This plugin's own policy, inspired by the exclusion list of the security-review command above. The following are NOT reported as vulnerabilities unless a concrete attack path is shown:
- Missing hardening alone (no exploitable consequence) — e.g. an absent security header; listed under "Hardening notes" (no severity), not as a finding
- Theoretical race conditions or timing attacks
- Denial of service and resource exhaustion without a shown attack path. Exceptions that ARE findings (the reachable endpoint is the attack path; severity by the single scale above): a missing rate limit on an authentication, password-reset, OTP or other abuse-prone endpoint, and a GraphQL endpoint without depth/cost limits that is reachable without authentication. The same gaps without a shown path are never silently dropped: they go to "Hardening notes"
- Code only in test files or only used to run tests
- Documentation files (Markdown) — EXCEPT agent-configuration files (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, rule, memory, skill, agent and command files), which skill `agentic-security` audits as executable instructions
- Outdated libraries — handled by skill `dependency-audit`, not as code findings

## Secrets

- Detection patterns: single source `skills/security-scan/references/secrets-patterns.md` (not repeated here).
- A secret value is NEVER printed in a report, log or message: file:line and secret type only.

## Dependencies

- Procedure and optional tools: skill `dependency-audit`. Audit CLIs are optional, checked with `command -v`, never installed; a missing tool is reported "not run".

## Report

Returned by the agent (read-only sandbox); the caller writes it to `docs/security/YYYY-MM-DD-<scope>.md` inside the audited repository (never a temp or hidden directory) and reports that path.

Contents:
1. Scope (repository or diff vs merge base) and date
2. Executive summary: findings count by severity
3. Findings, each with: id, title, severity, confidence (1-10), CWE, standard reference, location (file:line, package@version or URL), evidence, exploit scenario, recommendation
4. Needs manual review (confidence < 8, with reason)
5. Hardening notes (missing hardening without a shown attack path; no severity)
6. Dependency audit results
7. Tools run / not run, and categories not covered (partial runs)
