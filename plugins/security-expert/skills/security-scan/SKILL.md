name: security-scan
description: Use when scanning a codebase or a change for XSS, injection, command execution, SSRF, path traversal, weak crypto, hardcoded secrets, insecure deserialization or any OWASP Top 10:2025 vulnerability, and reporting verified findings.
---

<objective>
This skill finds and reports application-code vulnerabilities. It combines a first-pass
pattern scanner shipped in `@fusengine/harness`, manual per-language patterns, optional
presence-checked tools (secret scanners, SAST engines), and a read-only refutation pass that keeps
only findings with confidence ≥ 8 and a concrete exploit scenario. Findings are mapped to CWE and
OWASP Top 10:2025 (plus the API Security Top 10 2023 for API code) and returned in a report that the caller writes to
`docs/security/YYYY-MM-DD-<scope>.md` in the audited repository.

It reports; it never fixes. Verified findings, each with a re-test check, go back to the caller.

# Security Scan Skill

## Workflow

1. **Scope.** Full repository by default. When asked to review a change (`--diff`, a PR, a
   branch), limit the scan to the files changed against the merge base and say so in the report
   header:
   `git diff --name-only $(git merge-base HEAD <base>)` (default `<base>`: the branch the caller
   names, else `origin/HEAD`). Unchanged files are read only to trace data flow, not reported.
2. **Detect** languages and frameworks from project markers (`package.json`, `composer.json`,
   `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `Package.swift`, `*.xcodeproj`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`,
   `Gemfile`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle*`, `*.csproj`) and from the file extensions actually present
   (`git ls-files | rg -o '\.[A-Za-z0-9]+$' | sort | uniq -c`).
3. **Automated first pass:**
   `bun ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/../node_modules/@fusengine/harness/dist/cli/bin.mjs scan <dir>`
   This is a first-pass pattern scanner, not a complete audit. Read what its output says it
   scanned. If it prints a coverage summary, compare it with step 2: every language or file type
   present in the repository but not reported as scanned is covered with the manual patterns
   below. The scanner prints a coverage summary only in releases that include it; if it prints none,
   treat every detected language as not covered and apply the manual patterns to all of them. A single `language` field is not a
   coverage summary: a coverage summary lists the languages and the number of files scanned for
   each.
4. **Manual patterns** for the languages not covered (or to complete the first pass):
   - JS/TS family (`.js .jsx .mjs .cjs .ts .tsx .mts .cts .vue .svelte .astro`), Next.js, TanStack
     Start, React, Astro → [scan-patterns.md](references/scan-patterns.md)
   - PHP / Laravel → [scan-patterns-php.md](references/scan-patterns-php.md)
   - Python, Swift/iOS, Go, Rust → [scan-patterns-extra.md](references/scan-patterns-extra.md)
   - Ruby, Java, Kotlin/Android, C# → [scan-patterns-other.md](references/scan-patterns-other.md)
   - GraphQL endpoint present → [graphql-security.md](references/graphql-security.md)
5. **Secrets** in every repository, any language → [secrets-patterns.md](references/secrets-patterns.md)
   (single source of secret patterns; optional git-history scan with a presence-checked tool).
6. **Optional SAST** when an engine is already installed (`command -v semgrep opengrep codeql`),
   with its licence conditions → [sast-tools.md](references/sast-tools.md). Never install a tool.
7. **Triage** every candidate → [triage.md](references/triage.md): refutation pass (source → sink,
   framework protections, reachability, test/doc/generated file), confidence 1-10, report only
   ≥ 8 with an exploit scenario, 5-7 to "needs manual review", then a second read-only pass.
   Severity is set by impact and exploitability there; it overrides the scanner's raw label and the
   "max severity" columns of the pattern references.
8. **Map** to CWE and OWASP Top 10:2025 → [owasp-top10.md](references/owasp-top10.md).
9. **Report** with [the report template](references/templates/scan-report.md): shared finding
   fields, scanner coverage (what really ran, what was absent), needs manual review, and a
   re-test check per finding. A secret value is never printed.

## Hand-off

The skill does not edit code and does not dispatch fixes. Return the report (the caller writes it and reports its path) and the
verified findings (id, severity, confidence, CWE, standard reference, `file:line`, evidence,
exploit scenario, recommendation, re-test check) to the caller, which decides who fixes them.
