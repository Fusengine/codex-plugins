# 09 - Create PR (Design)

**Prepare the PR with visual documentation, then hand the push / PR / CI / merge / tag to the `commit` agent (full mode).** This phase never pushes, opens, merges or tags anything itself.

## When to Use

- After sniper validation (08-sniper-check)
- When design work is complete
- At the end of the mandate, when the work is ready to leave the working branch

---

## Hand-off to the Commit Agent (end of mandate)

This phase never runs `git push`, `gh pr create`, `gh pr merge`, a rebase onto main, a force-push or a tag. Once the validation checklist below is green and the Verify + sniper proofs (screenshots included) are in the REPORT, the release goes to the `commit` agent in **full mode** (AGENTS.md Git policy; `$commit-pro:commit` + `$commit-pro:git-flow`):

- It pushes the working branch, opens the PR (against the repo's base branch, e.g. `develop`), waits for CI, merges with a real `--merge` commit — never squash, which would orphan the release tag's bump commit — then tags post-merge and watches the release run.
- The lead launches it at the end of the mandate and announces the merge/release in the report to the owner; an APEX sub-agent never launches it and never runs those commands itself.
- Brief it with: `mode: full`, the PR title and body below, screenshot paths, the base branch, and the files of the mandate.
- Blocked (merge conflict, secret in the diff) → it stops with `status: blocked`; CI red → `status: left-open`, `ci: failed:<check>`. Either way: fix, re-validate, hand off again.
