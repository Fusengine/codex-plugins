# 09 - Create PR

**Run the pre-PR checks, prepare the PR title and body, then hand the push / PR / CI / merge / tag to the `commit` agent (full mode).** This phase never pushes, opens, merges or tags anything itself.

## When to Use

- After all validation passes (eLicit, Verify, sniper)
- After tests pass
- At the end of the mandate, when the work is ready to leave the working branch

---

## Pre-PR Checklist (run by the APEX agent)

```text
□ All commits are WIP commits made by the commit agent (conventional `type(scope):` messages)
□ sniper validation passes (zero errors)
□ All tests pass — run the project's test script, not a subset
□ Build succeeds — run the project's build script
□ Self-review completed
□ No console.logs/debug code
□ No TODO comments unaddressed
```

Run each check for real and paste the command + result in your REPORT; a check not run is reported "not verified".

---

## Hand-off to the Commit Agent (end of mandate)

This phase never runs `git push`, `gh pr create`, `gh pr merge`, a rebase onto main, a force-push or a tag. Once the checks above are green and the Verify + sniper proofs are in the REPORT, the release goes to the `commit` agent in **full mode** (AGENTS.md Git policy; `$commit-pro:commit` + `$commit-pro:git-flow`):

- It pushes the working branch, opens the PR, waits for CI, merges with a real `--merge` commit — never squash, which would orphan the release tag's bump commit — then tags post-merge and watches the release run.
- The lead launches it at the end of the mandate and announces the merge/release in the report to the owner; an APEX sub-agent never launches it and never runs those commands itself.
- Brief it with: `mode: full`, the PR title and body below, and the files of the mandate.
- Blocked (merge conflict, secret in the diff) → it stops with `status: blocked`; CI red → `status: left-open`, `ci: failed:<check>`. Either way: fix through the APEX loop (`06-fix-issue.md`), re-run the checks, hand off again.
- Branch out of date with main → the commit agent's flow handles it; never rebase and force-push a shared branch yourself (force-push needs the owner).

## PR Best Practices

### Size Guidelines

```text
✅ Small PRs (<400 lines changed)
   - Easier to review
   - Faster feedback
   - Lower risk

⚠️ Medium PRs (400-800 lines)
   - Split if possible
   - Detailed description needed

❌ Large PRs (>800 lines)
   - Split into smaller PRs
```

### Review-Friendly PRs

```text
✅ Single logical change
✅ Clear, descriptive title
✅ Thorough description
✅ Linked issues
✅ Test instructions
✅ Screenshots for UI
✅ Self-reviewed
```

---

## After the Hand-off

```text
□ Commit agent report read: PR URL, CI result, merge commit, tag (`git merge-base --is-ancestor vX.Y.Z main`)
□ Close related issues / update project board if the mandate asks
□ Report to the owner: merge/release announced, with the PR URL and tag
```

---

## Update Task Phase

At the **start** of this phase, record it (and mark the task `completed` once the commit agent reports the merge) in `.codex/apex/task.json`:

```bash
jq --arg p "create-pr" '.tasks[.current_task].phase = $p' .codex/apex/task.json \
  > .codex/apex/task.json.tmp && mv .codex/apex/task.json.tmp .codex/apex/task.json
# after the commit agent reports the merge:
jq '.tasks[.current_task].status = "completed"' .codex/apex/task.json \
  > .codex/apex/task.json.tmp && mv .codex/apex/task.json.tmp .codex/apex/task.json
```
