# 04 - Validation

**Verify code quality with sniper agent (APEX Phase X).**

## Gate — Required Proof Artefacts

**Validation does NOT start** without both proofs for the current task, each carried by the agent REPORT or by its optional record under `docs/verify/` (slug from the git branch, per the `verification` skill — never under `.codex/`, which the Codex sandbox keeps read-only):
- **eLicit** — the Step 5 report (techniques, verdicts, evidence, challenge verdict), or `docs/verify/elicit-<branch-slug>.json`.
- **Verify** — one evidence item per criterion + the challenge verdict, or `docs/verify/<branch-slug>.md`.

A claim made in context ("I already verified/elicited this") is not proof — only the reported evidence or the record is:

```bash
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
if [ -n "$BRANCH" ]; then
  BRANCH_SLUG=$(printf '%s' "${BRANCH#*/}" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed 's/[^a-z0-9]/-/g')
else
  BRANCH_SLUG="detached-$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"
fi
if [ -f "docs/verify/elicit-${BRANCH_SLUG}.json" ]; then
  echo "✅ eLicit record: docs/verify/elicit-${BRANCH_SLUG}.json"
else
  echo "ℹ️ No docs/verify/elicit-${BRANCH_SLUG}.json — the eLicit verdict must be in the agent REPORT. No such report → go back to references/03.5-elicit.md first."
fi
if [ -f "docs/verify/${BRANCH_SLUG}.md" ]; then
  echo "✅ Verify record: docs/verify/${BRANCH_SLUG}.md"
else
  echo "ℹ️ No docs/verify/${BRANCH_SLUG}.md — the Verify proof must be in the agent REPORT (evidence per criterion + challenge verdict). No such report → go back to the verification skill first."
fi
```

Only once both proofs are present does this phase proceed. The challenger runs SYSTEMATICALLY at every eLicit round and every Verify gate (Step 4.5 of `03.5-elicit.md`, Step 6 of the `verification` skill), no exceptions; its verdict (`CONFIRMED` / `REFUTED` / `UNCERTAIN`) travels in the Verify REPORT (or the `docs/verify/<branch-slug>.md` record). A `REFUTED` verdict must be resolved or explicitly owner-accepted before this gate is considered passed.

## When to Use

- After execution phase complete
- Before any code review
- After ANY code modification

---

## Launch sniper Agent

### Mandatory After Every Change

```text
sniper agent performs 6-phase validation:

Phase 1: explore-codebase
→ Verify file structure
→ Check for violations

Phase 2: research-expert
→ Verify patterns match docs

Phase 3: grep usages
→ Find all references
→ Check for breaks

Phase 4: run linters
→ Language-specific linters
→ Type checks
→ Style violations

Phase 5: apply fixes
→ Auto-fix what's possible
→ Manual fixes for complex issues

Phase 6: ZERO errors
→ Must pass completely
→ No warnings ignored
```

---

## Validation Tools (Language-Specific)

| Language | Linter | Formatter | Type Check |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TypeScript | ESLint | Prettier/Biome | tsc |
| PHP | PHPStan/Larastan | Pint/PHP-CS | Psalm |
| Python | Ruff/Pylint | Black/Ruff | mypy |
| Swift | SwiftLint | swift-format | Compiler |
| Go | golangci-lint | gofmt | Compiler |
| Rust | Clippy | rustfmt | Compiler |

---

## Validation Checks

### Code Quality

```text
□ No type errors
□ No linter errors or warnings
□ Formatted correctly
□ No unused imports/variables
□ No unsafe types (any, etc.)
```

### File Structure

```text
□ All files within `FUSE_SOLID_MAX_LINES` (default 200) lines
□ Interfaces in correct location
□ No interfaces in components
□ Correct file naming
□ Proper directory structure
```

### Documentation

```text
□ Doc comments on all exports
□ Complex logic commented
□ README updated if needed
□ Types self-documenting
```

---

## Build Verification

### Run Build (Language-Specific)

```text
TypeScript/JS: npm run build / pnpm build
PHP/Laravel:   composer build / php artisan
Python:        python -m py_compile
Swift:         swift build / xcodebuild
Go:            go build ./...
Rust:          cargo build
```

### Expected Output

```text
✅ Build successful
✅ No type errors
✅ No warnings (or documented exceptions)
✅ Output size acceptable
```

---

## Common Issues

### Type Errors

```text
Problem: Property/method does not exist
Fix: Add type guard, optional chaining, or fix type

Problem: Type mismatch
Fix: Cast correctly or fix source type
```

### Linter Errors

```text
Problem: Unused variable/import
Fix: Remove or prefix with underscore

Problem: Missing documentation
Fix: Add doc comment

Problem: File too long
Fix: Split into multiple files
```

### Import/Module Errors

```text
Problem: Cannot find module
Fix: Verify path, check exports, check package installed
```

---

## Fix Workflow

### If Errors Found

```text
1. Read error message carefully
2. Identify root cause
3. Fix in correct file
4. Re-run validation
5. Repeat until ZERO errors
```

### Common Fixes

| Error Type | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Type error | Add/fix type annotations |
| Unused import | Remove import |
| Missing export | Add export statement |
| Format error | Run formatter |
| File too long | Split file |

### Fix Discipline (Hypothesis-Driven)

**Fix discipline (hypothesis-driven).** One candidate cause documented before any edit → one atomic change → retest immediately. If it still fails, the hypothesis was wrong: the same fix is FORBIDDEN — run a fresh research round (Context7 → Exa) for a new hypothesis. Cap: 3 cycles per error; at the 3rd failure STOP and escalate (`status: fail` + root-cause: what was tried, sources, why each failed). Never stack two unverified corrections. Canonical implementation: sniper's Fix Retry Loop.

## Validation Checklist

```text
□ sniper agent launched
□ All 6 phases completed
□ ZERO linter errors
□ ZERO type errors
□ All files within `FUSE_SOLID_MAX_LINES` (default 200) lines verified
□ Build successful
□ No regressions detected
```

---

## Update Task Phase

At the **start** of this phase, record it in `.codex/apex/task.json`:

```bash
jq --arg p "validation" '.tasks[.current_task].phase = $p' .codex/apex/task.json \
  > .codex/apex/task.json.tmp && mv .codex/apex/task.json.tmp .codex/apex/task.json
```

---

## Next Phase

→ Proceed to `05-review.md` (self-review)
→ OR `07-add-test.md` (if tests needed first)
