# 09 - Create PR (Laravel)

**Run the Laravel pre-PR checks, prepare the PR title and body, then hand the push / PR / CI / merge / tag to the `commit` agent (full mode).** This phase never pushes, opens, merges or tags anything itself.

## When to Use

- After all validation passes (eLicit, Verify, sniper)
- After self-review complete
- At the end of the mandate, when the feature is ready to leave the working branch

---

## Pre-PR Checks (run by the APEX agent)

```bash
composer quality && \
php artisan test
```

### Quality Gates

```text
[ ] Larastan level 8+ passes
[ ] Pint passes (no style issues)
[ ] All Pest tests pass
[ ] Coverage > 80%
[ ] All files within `FUSE_SOLID_MAX_LINES` (default 200) lines
[ ] Self-review completed
```

### Code Readiness

```text
[ ] No debug code (dd, dump, ray)
[ ] No commented-out code
[ ] PHPDoc complete
[ ] Migrations reversible
[ ] Routes documented in api.php
```

Paste each command + result in your REPORT; a check not run is reported "not verified".

---

## Hand-off to the Commit Agent (end of mandate)

This phase never runs `git push`, `gh pr create`, `gh pr merge`, a rebase onto main, a force-push or a tag. Once the checks above are green and the Verify + sniper proofs are in the REPORT, the release goes to the `commit` agent in **full mode** (AGENTS.md Git policy; `$commit-pro:commit` + `$commit-pro:git-flow`):

- It pushes the working branch, opens the PR, waits for CI, merges with a real `--merge` commit — never squash, which would orphan the release tag's bump commit — then tags post-merge (and deletes the merged branch) and watches the release run.
- The lead launches it at the end of the mandate and announces the merge/release in the report to the owner; an APEX sub-agent never launches it and never runs those commands itself.
- Brief it with: `mode: full`, the PR title and body below, and the files of the mandate.
- Blocked (merge conflict, secret in the diff) → it stops with `status: blocked`; CI red → `status: left-open`, `ci: failed:<check>`. Either way: fix through the APEX loop (`06-fix-issue.md`), re-run the checks, hand off again.
- Branch out of date with main → the commit agent's flow handles it; never rebase and force-push a shared branch yourself (force-push needs the owner).

## Update Task Phase

At the **start** of this phase, record it (and mark the task `completed` once the commit agent reports the merge) in `.codex/apex/task.json`:

```bash
jq --arg p "create-pr" '.tasks[.current_task].phase = $p' .codex/apex/task.json \
  > .codex/apex/task.json.tmp && mv .codex/apex/task.json.tmp .codex/apex/task.json
# after the commit agent reports the merge:
jq '.tasks[.current_task].status = "completed"' .codex/apex/task.json \
  > .codex/apex/task.json.tmp && mv .codex/apex/task.json.tmp .codex/apex/task.json
```
