# SOLID Principles - Ruby Quick Reference

## Principles Overview

| Principle | Summary | Ruby Pattern |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **SRP** | One responsibility per class | Controller, Service, Query object |
| **OCP** | Open for extension, closed for modification | Strategy/Module-based extensibility |
| **LSP** | Implementations honor duck type contracts | Contract consistency |
| **ISP** | Small, focused modules/concerns | Role-based module splitting |
| **DIP** | Depend on abstractions (duck typing) | Constructor injection |

---

## Architecture Rules (Modules MANDATORY)

```
app/
├── modules/
│   ├── [feature]/
│   │   ├── controllers/     # HTTP handlers
│   │   ├── services/        # Business logic
│   │   ├── repositories/    # Data access
│   │   ├── contracts/       # Duck typing modules ONLY
│   │   ├── models/          # ActiveRecord
│   │   └── concerns/        # Shared behavior
│   └── core/                # Shared (cross-feature)
│       ├── services/
│       ├── contracts/
│       └── concerns/
└── config/
```

**NEVER use flat `app/` structure - always `app/modules/[feature]/`**

---

## File Size Limits

Every file stays within the hook ceiling `FUSE_SOLID_MAX_LINES` (default 200). One purpose per file: controllers stay thin, contracts hold duck-typing modules only; split mixed responsibilities.

---

## Contract Location (CRITICAL)

| Scope | Location |
|-------|----------|
| Feature contracts | `app/modules/[feature]/contracts/` |
| Shared contracts | `app/modules/core/contracts/` |
| **FORBIDDEN** | Contracts in implementation files |

**Ruby uses duck typing**: Contracts are modules defining expected interface.

---

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Files within `FUSE_SOLID_MAX_LINES` (default 200)
- [ ] Contracts in `modules/[feature]/contracts/` or `modules/core/contracts/`
- [ ] Services accept duck-typed dependencies
- [ ] `# frozen_string_literal: true` in every file
- [ ] YARD documentation on public methods
- [ ] Thin controllers (delegate to services)
- [ ] DRY: Grep before creating new code
