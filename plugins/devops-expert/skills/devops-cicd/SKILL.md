name: devops-cicd
description: Use when writing, reviewing or debugging CI/CD pipelines for self-hosted infrastructure - GitHub Actions (workflows, reusable workflows, composite actions, matrix, concurrency, caching, environments with required reviewers, OIDC instead of stored secrets, pinning actions by SHA or lockfile, permissions least privilege, self-hosted runners), GitLab CI (rules, needs, includes and components, environments, resource_group, protected variables, runners and executors), pointers for Jenkins / Forgejo-Gitea Actions / Woodpecker, pipeline design (build once promote many, quality gates, speed), image builds in CI (BuildKit cache, multi-arch, provenance/SBOM/signing), deploy strategies and rollback, release automation and troubleshooting. Not for GitOps controllers, Helm or Kustomize (devops-gitops-packaging), Dockerfile and registry craft (devops-docker), secret stores (devops-secrets), language-specific CI gates (framework experts), repo commit/release flow (commit agent) or a supply-chain audit (security-expert).

# DevOps CI/CD

## Agent Workflow (MANDATORY)

Before ANY pipeline change, spawn in parallel, one `spawn_agent` call each:

1. **explore-codebase** - find existing workflows (`.github/workflows`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`, `.woodpecker`), scripts they call, runners/labels in use, environments, how deploys reach the target
2. **research-expert** - verify the keyword, action version and runner image for the platform version in use at docs.github.com / docs.gitlab.com
3. **mcp__context7__query-docs** - confirm action inputs and CLI flags

Then read the platform state read-only (`gh run list`, `gh workflow list`, `gh api .../environments`, CI Lint, runner status). After writing files, run **sniper**; run `actionlint` on GitHub workflows when installed.

Docs examples often lag the latest action majors: use the SHA/tag from the release, and re-check with `gh api repos/<owner>/<action>/releases/latest` and `gh api repos/<owner>/<action>/commits/<tag> --jq .sha` before pinning.

Pinned versions:

```yaml
github-actions-runner: "2.338.2 (actions/runner release 2026-10-26)"
github-hosted-runner-labels: "ubuntu-latest = ubuntu-24.04; ubuntu-26.04 and ubuntu-24.04-arm available"
gitlab: "19.5 released (19.6 upcoming); GitLab Runner 19.5.3 (2026-11-06)"
actions-pinned-in-templates: "checkout v7.0.1, upload-artifact v7.0.2, setup-node v7.1.0, docker/build-push-action v7.4.0, actions/attest v4.2.2"
```

## Overview

| Area | Decision in one line |
|------|----------------------|
| **Artifact** | Build once, promote the same immutable artifact (image digest) through every environment |
| **Permissions** | `permissions: {}` at the top, widen per job; `GITHUB_TOKEN` read-only by default |
| **Actions** | Pin third-party actions by full SHA or lockfile; Dependabot raises bumps |
| **Credentials** | OIDC federation, bound to repo + environment claims; no long-lived cloud/SSH keys in CI |
| **Production** | Environment with required reviewers (GitHub) / protected environment + manual job (GitLab), serialised, never auto-cancelled |
| **Runners** | Ephemeral or private-only; never self-hosted on public repos; separate runner group for deploys |
| **Speed** | Parallel jobs, DAG (`needs`), lockfile-keyed cache, external BuildKit cache, cancel redundant PR runs |
| **Deploy model** | CI hands off to GitOps when a controller owns the cluster; otherwise push with a short-lived credential |

## Critical Rules

1. **Read before writing** - inspect existing workflows, runners, environments and what the deploy step actually touches
2. **Pin and constrain** - SHA/lockfile pins, `permissions`, `timeout-minutes` on every job
3. **No untrusted `${{ }}` in `run:`** - pass through `env:`; never check out PR code under `pull_request_target`/`workflow_run`
4. **Production and destructive pipeline actions are proposed, not run** - deploy, forced re-run, rollback, deleting environments/releases/tags/artifacts, unregistering runners: ACTION / EFFECT / PROOF / WAIT-FOR-GO in [destructive-pipeline-actions.md](references/destructive-pipeline-actions.md)
5. **Never print a secret value** - names only; stores and rotation are `devops-secrets`
6. **Never invent a keyword, input or version** - cite the docs page or release; unknown = "not verified"
7. **Troubleshoot in order** - run, class, log, reproduce, one change, prove ([troubleshooting.md](references/troubleshooting.md))

## Quick Reference

```bash
gh workflow list; gh run list --limit 10                 # read-only state
gh run view <id> --log-failed                            # why it failed
gh api repos/<o>/<r>/environments --jq '.environments[].name'
gh api repos/actions/checkout/commits/v7.0.1 --jq .sha   # SHA to pin
actionlint .github/workflows/*.yml                       # when installed
gh workflow run deploy.yml -f image-digest=sha256:...    # PRODUCTION: only after the user's go
```

## Best Practices

### DO
- Give every workflow `permissions`, `concurrency` and a `timeout-minutes` per job
- Hand deploys to GitOps (`devops-gitops-packaging`) where a controller exists
- Keep CI steps as scripts/make targets that run locally
- Record the previous artifact digest before each production deploy

### DON'T
- Rebuild per environment, deploy `latest`, or store cloud/SSH keys as long-lived CI secrets
- Run self-hosted persistent runners on public repositories
- Use `pull_request_target` with a PR checkout
- Set `cancel-in-progress: true` on deploy jobs
