description: Use when operating a private OpenStack cloud - mapping how a request flows through Keystone, Nova, Neutron/OVN, Glance, Cinder and Placement, picking a release and its SLURP upgrade path, choosing and running Kolla-Ansible, OpenStack-Ansible or OpenStack-Helm, sizing a small production control plane, day-2 work with the `openstack` CLI and `clouds.yaml` (projects, quotas, flavors, images, networks, routers, security groups, volumes, instances), series upgrades, or troubleshooting "No valid host", port binding failures, volume attach errors and RabbitMQ / MariaDB-Galera health. Not for Ceph internals (devops-storage-backup), the Terraform/OpenTofu OpenStack provider (devops-iac), generic Ansible (devops-ansible), Kubernetes itself (devops-kubernetes) or public clouds.
---

<objective>
Covers running a private OpenStack cloud end to end: the service map and request
flow, the release model (two releases a year, SLURP skip-level upgrades), the
choice and use of Kolla-Ansible, OpenStack-Ansible or OpenStack-Helm, small
production control-plane sizing, day-2 operations with the `openstack` CLI,
series upgrades and troubleshooting per deployment tool.
Does not cover Ceph internals (devops-storage-backup), the Terraform/OpenTofu
provider (devops-iac), Ansible in general (devops-ansible), Kubernetes itself
(devops-kubernetes, devops-k8s-cluster), public clouds, or vendor
distributions (Red Hat OpenStack Services on OpenShift, Canonical Sunbeam):
for those, read the vendor's own documentation.

# DevOps OpenStack

## Agent Workflow (MANDATORY)

Before advising or changing anything, run in parallel (one `spawn_agent` call each):

1. **explore-codebase** - find existing `globals.yml`, `passwords.yml`, inventories, `openstack_user_config.yml`, `clouds.yaml`, Helm values overrides
2. **research-expert** - re-read https://releases.openstack.org/ and the deployment tool docs for the target series (versions move every six months)
3. **mcp__context7__query-docs** - library `/websites/openstack` for the exact command or config key

After writing config or templates, run **sniper**.

## Overview

| Area | What this skill gives |
|------|-----------------------|
| **Service map** | Which service owns what, and the path of `openstack server create` through Keystone → Nova → Placement → Glance/Neutron/Cinder |
| **Releases** | Current, SLURP and next series; which upgrade jumps are tested |
| **Deployment** | Kolla-Ansible vs OpenStack-Ansible vs OpenStack-Helm, plus a 3-controller baseline |
| **Day-2** | `clouds.yaml`, read-only discovery, project bootstrap, quotas, images, networks, volumes, instances |
| **Upgrades** | Backup, prechecks, per-tool upgrade commands, verification |
| **Troubleshooting** | Logs per tool, the four classic failure chains, control-plane health |

## Critical Rules

1. **Read-only discovery first on a live cloud**: `openstack service list`, `openstack compute service list`, `openstack network agent list`, `openstack volume service list` - then plan, change, verify ([operations-cli.md](references/operations-cli.md)).
2. **Destructive commands are proposed, never run on your own**: `openstack server delete`, `volume delete`, `network delete`, `router delete`, `project delete`, `project cleanup`, `kolla-ansible destroy`, `kolla-ansible stop`, `nova-manage db purge`. Show the exact effect and the object list, then wait for the user's go.
3. **Upgrade only along a tested path**: adjacent series, or SLURP to SLURP. Never skip from a non-SLURP release ([release-upgrade-slurp.md](references/release-upgrade-slurp.md)).
4. **Back up before any series upgrade or DB-touching action**: deployment config (`/etc/kolla` or `/etc/openstack_deploy`) and the MariaDB data. Nova cannot downgrade its database.
5. **Odd-sized quorum**: MariaDB-Galera and RabbitMQ need 3 (or 5) controllers; 2 gives no HA.
6. **Never invent a key or flag**: every `globals.yml` key and CLI option in this skill was checked against the 2026.2 docs or source; anything else is verified first or reported as unknown.
7. **Secrets stay out of output**: `passwords.yml`, `user_secrets.yml`, `clouds.yaml` passwords and application credential secrets are never printed, committed or pasted (devops-secrets).

openstack token issue -f value -c expires           # auth works

openstack compute service list                      # nova-* up/enabled per host
openstack network agent list                        # OVN controller / metadata agents alive
openstack volume service list                       # cinder-scheduler / cinder-volume up
openstack quota show --usage <project>              # quota vs consumption
openstack server event list <server>                # what Nova did to an instance

## Best Practices

### DO
- Pin the deployment tool to the series branch or tag (`stable/2026.2`, OSA tag `33.1.0`) and install `python-openstackclient` with the series upper constraints
- Keep the whole deployment config in git; diff it against the new sample files at each upgrade
- Use application credentials in automation instead of user passwords
- Use OVN (`neutron_plugin_agent: "ovn"` in Kolla, the OSA default `ml2.ovn`) for new clouds
- Schedule MariaDB backups and test a restore before you need one

### DON'T
- Run `kolla-ansible upgrade` with `--limit` (the docs report known bugs with it)
- Put host-specific variables in Kolla `globals.yml` (highest precedence, applies to every host)
- Upgrade a non-SLURP release by two series at once
- Expect `enable_swift` in Kolla 2026.2 - the key is not in the sample `globals.yml`; use Ceph RGW (`enable_ceph_rgw`)
- Treat `openstack project delete` as cleanup - it removes the project, not its servers, volumes or networks (`project cleanup --dry-run` first)
